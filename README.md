# OUTCAR_to_MACExyz_mod

This program was originally generated by Poyen Chen, The University of Tokyo.
The original program was modified to be used for large supercells.

In particular around Line 74 as below

                if "direct lattice vectors" in line:
                    l_found = True
                    l_l = 0
                    lattice = []
                if l_found:
                    l_l += 1
                    if line.isspace():
                        l_found = False
                        if step_counter % interval == 0 or step_counter == 1:
                            all_lattice.append(lattice)
                        continue
                    if l_l >= 2:
                        # Insert a space before any negative sign that follows a number without a space
                        line = re.sub(r'(\d)-', r'\1 -', line)
                        l_line = " ".join(line.split()).split()
                        lattice.extend(l_line[:3])

was changed for more than two digit with minus lattice. I was generated by Cryspy.

# How to use
Same as the original program.

If you have "OUTCAR_000000" and "OUTCAR_000001" files in the folder,  

```
%python OUTCAR_to_MACExyz4.py OUTCAR_000000 OUTCAR_000001 ... 
```
